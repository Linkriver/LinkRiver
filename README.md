- 👋 Hi, I’m @LinkRiver, a Chainlink node service provider.
- 👀 I’m interested in operating highly reliable Chainlink node environments on various main chains, side chains and L2s.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything about decentralized technologies.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all kinds of tools and documentation helping others to spin up and maintain their own node infrastructure.
