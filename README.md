- 👋 Hi, I’m @Linkriver
- 👀 I’m interested in deploying highly available and secure Chainlink nodes on all kinds of blockchain networks.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything about Chainlink, DLT and smart contracts.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all kinds of documentation helping others to spin up their own node infrastructure.
